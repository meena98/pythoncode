1.i could have solved another question but i was slow compared to the given time
2.very bad 
3.i was nervous as i always am before any test.during the test i wasnt able to code the right solution 
  it wasnt like i didnt practise at all but i couldnt do well
4.i knew i did really bad so i wasnt expecting a good score
5.i guess in need more practise obviously and i need to be a lot faster
